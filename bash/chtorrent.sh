# Make sure that the directories I create in the torrent directory belong to debian-transmission.
# I create them with root access to keep that video collection tidy, for access through samba share.
# Ownership must be changed before transmission moves the files from the download folder to their
# rightfull location upon download completion.
#
# I added a little more than I wanted to at first.
# That's in case I download or move anything to this directory, like subtitles.
# The right umask is set in transmission-daemon (0022),
# but just in case, ownerships and permissions are always covered.
