# Bash scripts

Some shell scripts written for my personnal use:

* *chtorrent.sh*: watch torrent directory with inotify and set proper permissions for new files.
* *dstatus.sh*: gather status information on a list of services and display it nicely. Written with upstart in mind.
* *format_OSA.sh*: format optical spectrum analyser data files to import them in spreadsheets.
* *update.sh*: upgrade system and RKHunter database at the same time so that I don't forget.
* *ghci-color* and *ghci-ng-color*: colorizes ghci's output. Based on [this original script](https://github.com/rhysd/ghci-color) but heavily modified (bugfixes and improvements). Designed with “solarized dark” in mind. ![ghci-ng-color output in a  solarized-dark themed gnome-terminal](/home/damien/src/scripts/bash/media/gnc.png)
