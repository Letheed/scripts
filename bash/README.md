# Bash scripts

Some shell scripts:

* *chtorrent.sh*: watch torrent directory with inotify and set proper permissions for new files.
* *dstatus.sh*: gather status information on a list of services and display it nicely. Written with upstart in mind.
* *format_OSA.sh*: format optical spectrum analyser data files to import them in spreadsheets.
* *update.sh*: upgrade system and RKHunter database at the same time.
* *ghci-color*: colorize ghci's output. Based on this [original script](https://github.com/rhysd/ghci-color) + fixes and improvements. Designed with "solarized dark" in mind.
