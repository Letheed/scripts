# Bash scripts

Some shell scripts written for my personnal use:

* watch torrent directory with inotify and set proper permissions for new files
* gather status information on a list of services and display it nicely (upstart only)
* format OSA data files to import them in spreadsheets
* upgrade system and RKHunter database at the same time so that I don't forget
